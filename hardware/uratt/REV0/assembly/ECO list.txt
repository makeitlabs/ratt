uRATT REV0 ECO list

ISSUE: J7 - LiPo connector pins swapped
REV0 fix: install connector backwards
X REV1 fix: swap pins on schematic/layout
----
ISSUE: LCD connector pins reversed (1-13)
REV0 fix: hand wired nest for one prototype, or install display backwards for bench testing
x REV1 fix: fix pinout and re-route (pinout fixed, not rerouted yet)
----
ISSUE: LCD backlight cathode (K) is connected to VCC and not GND
REV0 fix: cut/jump to attach pin to GND
X REV1 fix: fix in schematic/layout
----
ISSUE: R51 should be 20 ohms per datasheet, possibly lower given dim backlight
REV0 fix: replace with 20 ohms
X REV1 fix: fix value in schematic
----
ISSUE: SD card does not work when R18 boot/programming strapping resistor is in place because IO2 needs to be pulled up for SD card
       and boot/programming fails if R18 removed
REV0 fix: connect IO2--(R 4.7K)---CP2102 DTR pin, DTR is pulled low during programming and thus boot works fine, and SD card pullup works when not programming
X REV1 fix: implement same fix in schematic/layout
----
ISSUE: Incorrect circuit for USB VBUS into CP2102N.
REV0 fix: Replace diode D1 with voltage divider VBUS---(R 22.1K)--o--(R 47.5K)--GND  Output of divider to CP2102N VBUS input
X REV1 fix: implement above fix, also add option with diode D1 to allow USB to power 5VIN? (option already existed, JP1)
----
ISSUE: CP2102N should have /RSTb signal pulled up to 3.3V with 1K resistor (missing in design)
REV0 fix: add pull up.  Works w/out it but datasheet suggests it.
X REV1 fix: add pull up.
----
ISSUE: Piezo beeper does not work, true piezos need a "bleeder" resistor across the buzzer since they are capacitive devices
REV0 fix: Replace current limiting resistor with 0 ohm, add bleeder resistor of 100 ohms across buzzer.
X REV1 fix: Change current limiting resistor to ~10 ohms, add bleeder and consider higher value (1k?).  
   OR consider switching to micro-speaker (louder/better frequency response), perhaps leave option for piezo
----
ISSUE: Front panel flat flex connectors challenging to solder, resulting in bridges or unconnected pins.
       Flat flex board connectors come unlatched easily.
REV0 fix: Careful hand soldering under microscope.  Hot glue cable/connectors once attached.
REV1 fix: Consider a new connector type.  If flat flex still the best choice, perhaps this vertical style TE Connectivity 1-1734742-0
----
ISSUE: Missing GND test point.  Test points should be on component side of board.
REV0 fix: None
x REV1 fix: Add GND TP, move TP's.
----
ISSUE: Front panel button missing pullup.
REV0 fix: Add 10K pullup.
x REV1 fix: Add 10K pullup in schematic/layout.
----
ISSUE: EN input on 5V boost converter must be 0.8V*VSW to enable.  3V logic output from ESP32 is too low to enable it.
REV0 fix: Add on circuit with NFET (FDV301N) and PFET (DMP31) so EN swings between GND and VSW and maintains proper logic levels.

                                                     GND	  
													 
X REV1 fix: implement above circuit in schematic/layout
----
ISSUE: 5V boost converter output very noisy, causes RFID reader range
REV0 fix: "power save" mode is used when output current is < 80mA.  Disable power save mode by tying SYNC to VSW instead of GND
x REV1 fix: implement above in schematic/layout
----
ISSUE: no values in schematic for "low battery detect" in 5V boost.
REV0 fix: calculate values per data sheet, R32=3M, R33=510K for theoretical 3.44V threshold.  Actual is measured higher, approx 3.6V? Explore more.
X REV1 fix: specify values.
----
ISSUE: System can't power up when ebaling 5V switcher unless battery is present and enabled
REV0 fix: VSW needs bulk capacitance, likely due to inrush when switcher is started.  Add 100uF to VSW.
x REV1 fix: implement above in schematic/layout
----
ISSUE: BAT54S diode clamps on Grove header are on the wrong side of current limiting R's
REV0 fix: none
x REV1 fix: move clamps
----

Considerations
- Simplify main board by moving power supply, battery charging, etc. to auxiliary board located in battery compartment of the doorknob?

- Add provisions for LEDs on main board (through-hole) so main board could be used without a front panel?  Or consider a simplified front panel or options on board for LEDs instead of display (keep buttons, beeper)

- Bring LiPo charge status bit into ESP32, but lacking I/O .. how to do?
