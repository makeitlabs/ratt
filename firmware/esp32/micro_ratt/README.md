# MakeIt Labs RATT: RFID All The Things (ESP32)

This is a simplified implementation of the RATT platform for the Espressif ESP32 platform.  It builds on early work done in 2017, before the Raspberry Pi Zero version of RATT was developed and deployed at the Labs.  This implementation is intended for use in different application scenarios where small physical size, reduced cost, reduced complexity, fast boot time, etc. may be desired.  It works with the same Auth Backend that has been developed for the "bigger brother" RATT and Doorbot projects.
